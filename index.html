                Italy was the birthplace and centre of the ancient Roman
                civilisation. Rome was founded as a kingdom in 753 BC and became
                a republic in 509 BC. The Roman Republic then unified Italy
                forming a confederation of the Italic peoples and rose to
                dominate Western Europe, Northern Africa, and the Near East
