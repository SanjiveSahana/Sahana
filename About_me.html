    <p>
      My name is Sahana Suresh. My birthday is on June 30 2014. I am 10 years
      old. My favorite color is lavender. My favorite food is alfredo pasta. Two
      of my hobby's are crocheting and painting. During summer break me and my
      neighbors play ping-pong. I like school but playing outside is way better.

      to cook. I can make french toast so far. My goal for 2024 is to make a
      meal for mom and dad's anaversiry. My favorite sport is soccer and in that
