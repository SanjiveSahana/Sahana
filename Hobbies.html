      <p>
        Crochet is a process of creating textiles by using a crochet hook to
        interlock loops of yarn, thread, or strands of other materials. The name
        is derived from the French term croc, which means 'hook'. Hooks can be
        made from a variety of materials, such as metal, wood, bamboo, bone or
        even plastic. The key difference between crochet and knitting, beyond
        the implements used for their production, is that each stitch in crochet
        is completed before the next one is begun, while knitting keeps many
        stitches open at a time. Some variant forms of crochet, such as Tunisian
        crochet and broomstick lace, do keep multiple crochet stitches open at a
        time. Etymology

      <p>
        Pickleball is a racket or paddle sport in which two players (singles) or
        four players (doubles) use a paddle to hit a perforated, hollow plastic
        ball over a 34-inch-high (0.86 m) net until one side is unable to return
        the ball or commits a rule infraction. Pickleball is played indoors and
        outdoors. It was invented in 1965 as a children's backyard game in the
        United States, on Bainbridge Island in Washington state. In 2022,
        pickleball was named the official state sport of Washington.

        painting is the process of taking in the sense or meaning of letters,
        symbols, etc., especially by sight or touch. For educators and
        researchers, reading is a multifaceted process involving such areas as
        word recognition, orthography (spelling), alphabetics, phonics, phonemic
        awareness, vocabulary, comprehension, fluency, and motivation. Other
        types of reading and writing, such as pictograms (e.g., a hazard symbol
        and an emoji), are not based on speech-based writing systems. The common
        link is the interpretation of symbols to extract the meaning from the
        visual notations or tactile signals (as in the case of braille)

      <p>
        Painting is a visual art, which is characterized by the practice of
        applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface
        (called the "matrix or "support"). The medium is commonly applied to the
        base with a brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and
        airbrushes, may be used.

        in the second half of the 2010s, and this growth has been accelerated by
