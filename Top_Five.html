    <h1>Top Five Cutest Animals In The World</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Cat</li>
      <p>
        The
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat" target="_blank">Cat</a>
        (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is
        the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often
        referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members
        of the family. A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral
        cat
      </p>
      <li>Dog</li>
      <p>
        The
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog" target="_blank">Dog</a> or
        domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a
        domesticated descendant of the wolf, and is characterized by an
        upturning tail. The dog is derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and
        the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. The dog was the
        first species to be domesticated. </p>
        <li>Rabbit</li>
        <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit" target="_blank">Rabbits</a>,
        also known as bunnies or bunny rabbits, are small mammals in the family
        Leporidae (which also contains the hares) of the order Lagomorpha (which
        also contains the pikas). Oryctolagus cuniculus includes the European
        rabbit species and its descendants, the world's 305 breeds of domestic
        rabbit

      <li>Hamster</li>
      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamster" target="_blank"
          >Hamster</a
        >
        have those little black eyes, cute tails, and depending on the type,
        they are so furry! The eyes stare into your soul with cuteness. Also,
        depending on the type of hamster, they have little stubby tails that are
        little balls of fluff!"Hamsters also have cute actions. They look like
        little fur balls in your hands, cage, or anywhere when they are cleaning
        themselves. They also look so adorable when they eat! Like, they look
        like little cuties. The only downside is that they can sometimes be
        unfriendly and have a habit of biting you. But, I don't blame them! It's
        just the way they were born. Like, it's the hamster way!

      <li>Fox</li>
      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox"target="_blank"
         >Foxes</a> 
        are small to medium sized animals and belong to the Canidae family along with other
        animals such as jackals, wolves, and domestic dogs. There are 37 species
        of fox but only 12 are considered true Vulpes. A fox's prey is small
        mammals, birds, reptiles, frogs, eggs, insects, worms, fish, crabs
